## 1. Modifying Code
Certain parts of the code had to be removed or altered since we cannot use print functions on the HPC. 
Therefore the whole generation of the plot can be deleted and instead just save the generated weights in a file "called best_weights.weights.h5"
Furthermore, we changed the path to the training set to the original one which was given in the projectdetails.pdf.
The code was saved in a file called "job.py" and executed in a virtual environment on our computer.


## 2. Necessary Files
The HPC needs three files in order to process the job:

the Python script "job.py"
the necessary modules "packages.txt"
and a bash script for submitting the job "submit.sh"

In order to make the required Python packages available for the HPC one can save them directly from the virtual environment into a list using a command like:
python -m pip freeze > packages.txt

The bash script was copied from the UBELIX documentation and complemented with some Slurm directives to load the Python module, activate the virtual environment, and ultimately execute the script. 

The files were saved in a new directory called on the user called "dic01" by copying them into nano.


## 3. Executing the job
A virtual environment had to be created in the directory, using the command:
python -m venv ENV

Now the job can be submitted using the command:
batch submit.sh

## 4. Downloading the Result
To facilitate the transfer of our generated results, we used the application Filezilla.
